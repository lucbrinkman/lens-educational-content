# Chat: Discussion on Feedback Loop
instructions::
The user just read about the intelligence feedback loop and recursive self-improvement. Check their understanding of the core dynamics: why intelligence makes it easier to create more intelligence, and the implications for AI development timelines.

instructions::
The user has now read Paul Christiano's perspective on recursive self-improvement and takeoff speeds. Compare this "slow takeoff" view with the previous readings. Help them understand the key disagreements about how quickly AI capabilities might advance.

# Chat: Synthesis Discussion
instructions::
The user has now read Yudkowsky's analysis of recursive self-improvement and
Tim Urban's exploration of accelerating progress and the road to superintelligence.
Discuss how these perspectives relate to the earlier readings on takeoff speeds
and the intelligence feedback loop.


The game monopoly
A positive feedbac loop is a system in which marginal differences multiply in such a way as to quickly dominate the system: Having even slightly more capital to reinvest in the next round will lead to an exponentially increasing gap between you and your competitor. 

Clean vs unclean cybernetics (cascades vs cycles)
A cascade lacks a universal equivalent (capital, neutrinos, general heuristic search). A cascade is a series of problems which share some small mutually applicable shards so that an insight in one probabilisticly opens up  some improvements in the others but without any guarantees. You don't *always* get more money to spend in the next round on anything. Cycles on the other hand are dominated by the shard which has a universal equivalent: Capital accrued in one industry can be spent in any other industry, on any bit of r&d etc. Performing well in a market anywhere will reliably increase your fitness everywhere. -> neutron multiplication. Intelligence, like primitive trade economies looks like a cascade for now. An insight somewhere only probabalisticly helps you elsewhere, but they do have a univerals equivalent which simply has not reached multiplication >1 yet: A heuristic search for better heuristic searches.

Good regulator theorem: Any good regulator of a system is a model of said system. A good regulator of reality broadly (a hyper-competent agent) is a model of reality. -> intelligence is a thin
