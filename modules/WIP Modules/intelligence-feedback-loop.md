The game monopoly
A positive feedback loop is a system in which marginal differences multiply in such a way as to quickly dominate the system: Having even slightly more capital to reinvest in the next round will lead to an exponentially increasing gap between you and your competitor. 

Clean vs unclean cybernetics (cascades vs cycles)
A cascade lacks a universal equivalent (capital, neutrinos, general heuristic search). A cascade is a series of problems which share some small mutually applicable shards so that an insight in one probabilisticly opens up  some improvements in the others but without any guarantees. You don't *always* get more money to spend in the next round on anything. Cycles on the other hand are dominated by the shard which has a universal equivalent: Capital accrued in one industry can be spent in any other industry, on any bit of r&d etc. Performing well in a market anywhere will reliably increase your fitness everywhere. -> neutron multiplication. Intelligence, like primitive trade economies looks like a cascade for now. An insight somewhere only probabalisticly helps you elsewhere, but they do have a univeral equivalent which simply has not reached multiplication >1 yet: A heuristic search for better heuristic searches.

Good regulator theorem: Any good regulator of a system is a model of said system. A good regulator of reality broadly (a hyper-competent agent) is a model of reality. -> recursively optimized predictions are a feedback system.

The economics case feels so easy to point at that it's hard to find basic sources about it. Bastani on marginal cost converging to zero is probably too specific and also not public domain. I'd want to use marx, but possibly aesthetically unwise.

A market too is a recursive system we can tell because anyone who isn’t going exponential is falling behind. The expected trajectory is for your new batch of profits generating a greater return on investment than the last. Like with heuristic improvement there come diminishing returns on any one branch fairly quickly, but the market is a sufficiently general problem that you should not run out of branches. You sufficiently optimized one good? Make a different one that synergizes with it. Eat the supply line, manufacture desire or just do something else entirely because prestige and capital are universal equivalents. Having had pretty good planning in step one allows you to pay for more of the time of better planners in step two.


For a neutron multiplication factor of intelligence to make sense you need a basic process of intelligence instead of a broad set of weakly related skills. Economic growth becomes general through the universal equivalent of money. Which can serve as neutrons everywhere. Intelligence has the heuristic search over prediction generators. A better search for predictions makes you better everywhere including in self improvement. This is necessarily a search for the true structure of reality. Intelligence is the thing converging towards being a good regulator of everything.

Most domain specific research is cascatic: it makes you locally fitter and might help on analogous patterns elsewhere. Production without a market is also cascadic. A bad business model is cyclic but with k < 1 : You do earn a universal currency that could be reinvested anywhere, so the process is already fully cybernetically enforcing, but you do not generate enough of it to afford the work that was put in and so the reaction fizzles. 


There is a type of process which reliably produces discontinuity beyond some critical mass. Intelligence has many of the properties of such a process.
