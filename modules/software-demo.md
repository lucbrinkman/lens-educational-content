**Key takeaways from this lesson:**

1. **Intelligence is power** - Humans dominate Earth because of general intelligence
2. **AI is different** - Digital minds can run faster, scale, and be copied
3. **The alignment problem** - Ensuring AI goals match human values is extremely difficult
4. **Expert concern** - Many leading researchers believe AI poses existential risk
5. **Timelines are uncertain** - AGI could arrive within years or decades

In the next lesson, we'll explore common objections to AI safety concerns
and how researchers respond to them.
