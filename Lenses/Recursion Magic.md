### Article: Recursion, Magic
source:: [[../articles/recursion-magic]] 

#### Text
content::
Getting to plug the outputs of a process back into the input does not necessarily lead to an explosion though. Consider the case of EURISKO.

#### Article-excerpt
from:: "We have historical records aplenty"
to:: "recursive enough."

#### Text
content::
What are the properties that make something a cycle rather than a cascade? Can you think of cycles that could form with regards to general intelligence?
#### Chat: Discussion on Cycles
instructions::
TLDR of what the user just read:
An article that explains EURISKO, an optimising compiler, and examines why such a program, if plugged into itself recursively does not generate an infinite degree of program optimisation. The answers given are that the input-output behaviour is left unchanged. An optimised EURISKO might optimize a program faster than its predecessor, but it still outputs the same thing.  

topics to explore:
- What would the optimisation have to be pointed at to cause an intelligence explosion?
- Where do speed and competence start to diverge?
- How can the notion of fizzling or fooming be linked back to the metaphor of neutron multiplication?
- What does a sufficiently recursive compute 

This is a good stage to raise worry about the ability to predict a system's abilities at time t+1 based on its abilities at time t.
