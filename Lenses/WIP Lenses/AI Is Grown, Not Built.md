### Article: AI Is Grown, Not Built
source:: [[]] https://archive.is/blU6r

#### Text
content::
We don’t "build" intelligence brick by brick; instead, we create conditions for it to develop using massive datasets. This "growth" leads to emergent properties, skills that the system wasn't explicitly taught and that often surprise the creators themselves. The first material in this module examines these features of the current AI development paradigm and explores the consequences of such an approach.

`<prompt the user on how they should interact with the chatbot>`{>>Example: In your own words, what is instrumental convergence?<<}
#### Chat: Discussion on X-Risk
instructions::
TLDR of what the user just read:{>>Example: 
AI x-risk is the hypothesis that AGI/superintelligence could cause human extinction
or irreversible collapse. The risk combines: capability advantages, recursive
self-improvement, and emerging dangerous capabilities (manipulation, cyberattacks,
bioweapons)—amplified by competitive "race to the bottom" dynamics. The core crux
is alignment: specifying goals, ensuring corrigibility, handling instrumental
convergence. Intelligence and values are orthogonal—moral behavior isn't automatic.<<}
`<TLDR text>`

Discussion topics to explore:{>>Examples:
- What is "instrumental convergence"? Why would any smart AI seek self-preservation and resources?
- What is the "Gorilla Problem" (Stuart Russell's analogy)?
- How do "Monkey's Paw" or "King Midas" effects apply to goal specification?
- What do skeptics like Yann LeCun argue, and what are the counter-arguments?
- Why might "kill switches" fail against superintelligence?<<}
- `<Discussion point 1>`
- `<Discussion point 2>`
- `<Discussion point 3>`
- `<Discussion point 4>`

Ask what they found surprising or new. Check if they can explain `<key concept>` in their own words—it's a key concept.
