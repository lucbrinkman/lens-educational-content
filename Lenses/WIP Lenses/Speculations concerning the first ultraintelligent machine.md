### Article: Speculations concerning the first ultraintelligent machine
source:: [[../../articles/good-speculations-concerning-first-ultraintelligent-machine]]

#### Text
content::
The issue with self amplifying loops is that plans become obsolete very quickly. The system a few steps down the line will be dominated by effects that are almost impossible to foresee from the starting line. I.J. Good recognised this when he wrote the following. 

#### Article-excerpt
from:: "The survival of man depends"
to:: "in his own image."

#### Article-excerpt
from:: "Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined"
to:: "value at a megakeynes."

#### Text

And if the first ultra intelligent machine is wort a mega-keynes, how much might the machine it builds be worth? 
#### Chat: Discussion on Objections
instructions::
TLDR of what the user just read:
An article that explains positive feedback loops especially with regards to civilisational competence. It explains "cascades" as breakthroughs which probabilisticly  opens up other breakthroughs in related fields and "cycles" as processes which generate some excess quantity that can be reinvested into the same process. Examples provided are neutron multiplication in radioactive materials as a cycle  and the development of writing leading to various civilisational breakthroughs as a cascade. 

topics to explore:
- Does it seem like intelligence has some universal equivalent that can be directly reinvested?
- What is AI's neutron multiplication factor?
- What are the properties that make something a cycle?
- How do cycles and cascades cause discontinuity in an otherwise gradual growth?
- How applicable do these concepts seem to artificial intelligence?

This is a good stage to raise worry about the ability to predict a system's abilities at time t+1 based on its abilities at time t.
