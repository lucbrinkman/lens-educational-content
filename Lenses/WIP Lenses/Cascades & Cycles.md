Hold these ideas about cybernetics in mind as you read the following article about types of feedback as they pertain to intelligence.

#### Article-excerpt
from:: "**Cascades** are when"
to:: "_What is the AI's average_ _neutron multiplication factor?_"

#### Text
content::
What are the properties that make something a cycle rather than a cascade? Can you think of cycles that could form with regards to general intelligence?
#### Chat: Discussion on Objections
instructions::
TLDR of what the user just read:
An article that explains positive feedback loops especially with regards to civilisational competence. It explains "cascades" as breakthroughs which probabilisticly  opens up other breakthroughs in related fields and "cycles" as  

topics to explore:
- Which objection did they find most initially convincing? Did their view change?
- How does instrumental convergence counter "just don't put in bad goals"?
- Why do implicit goals make systems less safe, not more?
- What's the flaw in "human-AI teams will keep things safe"?
- How does the video respond to the "overpopulation on Mars" analogy?

This is a good stage to surface any remaining skepticism they have. Engage with their doubts constructively rather than dismissing them.
