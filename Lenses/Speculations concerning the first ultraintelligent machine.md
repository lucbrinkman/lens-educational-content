### Article: Speculations concerning the first ultraintelligent machine
source:: [[../articles/good-speculations-concerning-first-ultraintelligent-machine]]

#### Text
content::
The issue with self amplifying loops is that plans become obsolete very quickly. The system a few steps down the line will be dominated by effects that are almost impossible to foresee from the starting line. I.J. Good recognised this when he wrote the following:

#### Article-excerpt
from:: "The survival of man depends"
to:: "in his own image."

#### Article-excerpt
from:: "Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined"
to:: "value at a megakeynes."

#### Text

And if the first ultra intelligent machine is wort a mega-keynes, how much might the machine it builds be worth? 
#### Chat: Intelligences building intelligences
instructions::
TLDR of what the user just read:
An article by I.J. Good speculating about the cognitive infrastructure of a thinking machine more capable than any human. He importantly claims that he will only speculate about the first agent of this kind since the second will be built by the first according to design considerations humans cannot yet fathom. Good claims that this might happen by way of the AI building a wholly different successor or by self-modifying until it becomes unrecognisable. He tries to measure the economic value of such a system in "mega-keynes" based on the fact that John Maynard Keynes was estimated to be the most valuable human to the world economy. 

topics to explore:
- We are a shape of intelligence grown by evolution and AI is a shape of intelligence grown by us. Will an intelligence grown or built by a hyper-intelligent AI be another such paradigm change? 
- C
- What are the properties that make something a cycle?
- How do cycles and cascades cause discontinuity in an otherwise gradual growth?
- How applicable do these concepts seem to artificial intelligence?

This is a good stage to raise worry about the ability to predict a system's abilities at time t+1 based on its abilities at time t.
