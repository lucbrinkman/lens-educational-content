### Article: What are the differences between a singularity, an intelligence explosion, and a hard takeoff?
source:: [[../articles/aisafety-info-singularity-intelligence-explosion-hard-takeoff]] 

#### Text
content::
Let's get acquainted with some of the terminology used for things going very fast very quickly.

#### Article-excerpt
from:: "* A **(technological) singularity**"
to:: "that results in hyperbolic growth."

#### Article-excerpt
from:: "* **FOOM**"

#### Chat: A more recursive mouse
instructions::
TLDR of what the user just read:
An article that explains EURISKO, an optimising compiler, and examines why such a program, if plugged into itself recursively does not generate an infinite degree of program optimisation. The answers given are that the input-output behaviour is left unchanged. An optimised EURISKO might optimize a program faster than its predecessor, but it still outputs the same thing.  

topics to explore:
- What would the optimisation have to be pointed at to cause an intelligence explosion?
- Where do speed and competence start to diverge?
- How can the notion of fizzling or fooming be linked back to the metaphor of neutron multiplication?
- What does a sufficiently recursive computer mouse look like? Is there such a thing? 

This is a good stage to consider whether intelligence/competence is a collection of separate skills or a single variable which can easily serve as its own input.
